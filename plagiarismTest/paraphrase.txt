A History of Settlement and Change in Yosemite Valley

The first non-natives to see Yosemite Valley were probably members of the mid-nineteenth century, Joseph Walker Party, who crossed the Sierra Nevada from east to west. The first descriptions of Yosemite came almost 20 years later. From the start, the valley has been renowned for its natural beauty, and highly regarded as the centerpiece of Yosemite National Park, attracting visitors from around the world.
