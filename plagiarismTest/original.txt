A Natural Setting

A History of Exploration and Settlement in Yosemite Valley

Since its first discovery by non-indigenous people in the mid-nineteenth century,
Yosemite Valley has held a special, even even religious,
hold on the American conscience because its beauty makes it an incomparable valley
and one of the grandest of all special temples of nature.
While Yosemite holds a special grip on the western mind,
perceptions about the Valley have evolved over time due to changing politics,
migration patterns and environmental concerns as man has become more attuned to
his relationship and impact on nature.
